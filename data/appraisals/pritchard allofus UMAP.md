> It's a pity that All of Us used UMAP to visualize ancestry variation in their new marker paper, out today in Nature. The UMAP algorithm, by design, exaggerates the distinctiveness of the most frequent ancestries, a message that can be misinterpreted by the public.

> UMAP pulls unusual genotypes towards the majority clusters; in particular it fails to represent admixture in a sensible way (admixture is fundamentally additive, while UMAP is not). In this setting the messiness of Admixture or PCA plots yield a better reflection of the data

> For the record, I'm not a UMAP hater in all settings, but I think it's misleading and potentially harmful for this specific problem.

Note:
- the critique of the data visualization generating process for this specific dataset is an example of #how/4cs/credibility 
- maybe also an instance of #how/4cs/communicability since it is critiquing different ways of communicating an analysis?
