> Thank you very much for both your comments! I‚Äôll try to reply to the other one as well soon!!

I don‚Äôt really know how to do the quotation thing as well as you do, so you‚Äôll have to excuse me!

Independent inventions of writing is incredibly rare and the reason we know that is because writing has only been independently invented four times, as I referenced earlier and I think 99.9% of all scholars would agree (well, maybe not in India afaik but you get my point).

That is a simple historical fact that, like almost all historical facts, is overlooked within much of linguistics (at least I gathered that much from my master‚Äôs in linguistics: gestures before speech in evolution of language?üòÇ).

Thus, whenever we are dealing with any pre-contact civilization, the assumption should always be that they are not producing writing¬†_because it‚Äôs only happened four times in history_, despite there being several large and great societies before, and contemporary with, literate societies. Like I said above, the Inca being a great example. The Japanese is another good example. Look at the kofun (?) tombs of the 400s, one of which is the largest tomb¬†_in the history of the wirld_, surpassing the pyramids at Giza or the tomb of the First Emperor of China, with the knowledge that literally next door the Chinese have been producing texts for over 1500 years, and that has had high literacy for at least 500 years, and ask how the Japanese did not produce writings until the 600s while accomplishing other great feats.

This gets into the problem of ‚Äúproto-writing‚Äù, which you address.

Proto-writing, as it regards independent invention of writing, can only exist in four places as of now: Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, and Mesoamerica (Maya).

As far as I know (not very well-read on this topic), we have very good evidence for the evolution of writing in Egypt and Mesopotamia, and virtually none in Mesoamerica. Being quite well-read in Chinese history, I know that we have nothing. One day, literally out of nowhere, the Chinese has a fully formed written system in 1250 BC. The theory of priests at the Taosi-temple is intriguing, but so far there is no hard evidence for it.

Thus, as far as I know, there are only two instances of proto-writing in the world. Egypt, and Mesopotamia. There cannot be more examples of proto-writing than that, and both of those show trade, taxation, and large demographic growth as the main catalysts.

‚ÄúProto-Latin‚Äù, or proto-anything, says nothing about the evolution of writing ex nihilo, only about how written system A transforms into written system B.

These are some of the more common misuses of history which I‚Äôve found so prevalent within linguistics. Just because something is true¬†_in theory_, does not mean that it should be held in equal regard with historical fact. Historical fact should always take precedence over ‚Äúwell in theory this makes sense‚Äù because a lot of contradictory things makes sense in theory. We have to work with provable historical fact as our basis.
